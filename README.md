Hi, I'm Laure, a french backend web developer.

My main skills are PHP, Symfony, HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Bootstrap, MySQL, Git, Github, Linux, and I'm going through the final course project of the [O'Clock](https://oclock.io) PHP web and mobile developer training where I hold the role of backend lead developer.
